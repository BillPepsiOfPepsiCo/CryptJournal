CryptJournal
============

A journaling app with personality (and encryption!).

Features
============

Comes complete with:

1) Journaling capabilities!

Watch in awe as you type the content of your entry on your keyboard and it shows up on the screen.
You will have the envy of your friends when they see how HTML text formatting is also available (but HTMLEditors are a tad
buggy and that's really not in my capabilities to fix).

2) Encryption!

So, what if a snoopy douchewagon tries to open your journal entries and view them in plaintext? You're one step ahead because CryptJournal
takes care of that for you! When you save your entries, CryptJournal automagically encrypts the text using the AES encryption algorithm
so it looks as if you wrote it while having a seizure drunk on your keyboard!

Not to worry, you can still view your dirty little secrets if you remember the password you used! Passwords are not cached in any way
(though that may become a feature some day, it's being thought over), so if you cannot remember your password, you cannot recover the lost data.

3) Configuration!

A new innovation in the software engineering community: options! You can currently configure the time and date format in the journal entry
list view and change which theme you wish to use (dark or light). You will soon be able to select which encryption algorithm to use!

4) Easter eggs!

I'm not going to go too into detail with this. They're not too complex, and if you dive around the source you'll find them. (Hint: they're in
the Controller class).

Downloads

Download the current stable build [here](http://google.com/). (not yet!)

Dependencies
============

This app depends on [ControlsFX](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) and my own commons library, [Easel](https://github.com/DoktuhParadox/Easel). Neither of these have to be downloaded for the binary to work.
